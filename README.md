# Research on Approaches from Data-Driven to Digital Transformation

## üìã Project Overview

This repository contains research on bridging the gap between data science model predictions and business decision-making through the **PAD (Prediction And Decision)** methodology. The research addresses a critical challenge in digital transformation: how to convert predictive analytics into actionable business strategies.

## üéØ Research Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: Develop a systematic approach to connect data science predictions with business strategy implementation
- **Key Innovation**: PAD methodology that bridges the prediction-decision gap using assumption, simulation, and optimization
- **Business Impact**: Enable automated, data-driven decision-making for marketing strategies and customer segmentation

## üìä Research Methodology

### PAD Framework (7-Step Process)

1. **Data Organization** - Collection and cleaning of transaction data
2. **Data Exploration** - Customer segmentation using RFM analysis
3. **Model Building** - Logistic and linear regression models
4. **Prediction** - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) calculation
5. **Business Assumptions** - Marketing tool cost-benefit analysis
6. **Simulation & Optimization** - ROI optimization across customer segments
7. **Decision Solutions** - Automated marketing strategy recommendations

### Technical Implementation

- **Dataset**: 54,000+ transaction records from OMO (Online-Merge-Offline) platform
- **Customer Profiles**: 18,000+ customer records with RFM attributes
- **Models**: 
  - Logistic Regression (85.2% accuracy, ROC AUC: 0.88)
  - Linear Regression (R¬≤: 0.713)
- **Segmentation**: 7 customer groups (N1, N2, R1, R2, S1, S2, S3)
```

## üîë Key Findings

### Model Performance
- **Repurchase Prediction**: 85.2% accuracy with ROC AUC of 0.88
- **Revenue Prediction**: R¬≤ value of 0.713
- **CLV Distribution**: Most customers' 5-period CLV between 100-200 yuan

### Business Impact
- **Targeted Marketing**: Identified 258 high-value customers in R2 group
- **ROI Optimization**: S1 customer group showed potential for 80,914 yuan profit
- **Automated Decision-Making**: Framework enables data-driven marketing strategies

### Customer Segmentation Results
- **High-Value Groups**: R2 (core customers), N2 (new potential customers)
- **Reactivation Targets**: S1, S2, S3 (sleeping customers)
- **Growth Opportunities**: N1 (new customers) for brand awareness

## üöÄ Applications

### Business Use Cases
1. **Customer Retention**: Automated identification of at-risk customers
2. **Marketing Optimization**: ROI-based campaign targeting
3. **Resource Allocation**: Data-driven budget distribution
4. **Strategic Planning**: Predictive insights for business decisions

### Industry Relevance
- **Retail & E-commerce**: Customer lifetime value optimization
- **Financial Services**: Risk assessment and customer scoring
- **Healthcare**: Patient engagement and treatment adherence
- **Telecommunications**: Churn prediction and service optimization
